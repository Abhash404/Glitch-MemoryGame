## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

None, followed the tutorial given.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

In creating this submission, i had a slight hitch on creating the gif for the video walkthrough. First I ws not sure to include all the files
and the demonstration of the application itself, so i took the longest time on making tht gif file part of the submission. The tutorials provided
were simple and very easy to follow. The HTML, CSS and javaScript codes were very simple and efficient to follow. It covered the basics of webdesign
and was perfectly explained. Implementing various practices after this tutorials were a bit difficult at the begining, some implementations on the 
javaScript part mostly, however after practicing it multiple times, i got the hang of it. And the best part is watching my code run smooth as butter.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

During web development, what are the strict policies that we need to follow? How many languages can simultaneously back up a webdesign to complete the backend
of the code within the same context of the code. What are the various other formats to make a web page other than the regular three? How do you implement a website
to a server without pipelining? How do you host a main domain? Where do we start to try this out (eg. Heroku, Netlify)? How much process can a single server handle?
How do you make a website global?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

create functions to match a certain block with a number or picture that matches a similar tone, call function regarding the win rate and take the difficulty up, which gradually increases the speed of the tone 
and the display, display all the number of wins and losses and outout the final result, as mentioned in the optional implementations, allow the user to manually choose to play against the clock, add a leaderboard
system, social media links to share the score and the applications as a whole, a function to compare the results between the last played game and the currently playing one, etc.
